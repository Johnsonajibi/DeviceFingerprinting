## Pull Request Description for OSS-Fuzz

**Title:** Add device-fingerprinting project

**Description:**

Hi! I'd like to add my device fingerprinting library to OSS-Fuzz.

This is a Python library that helps identify hardware devices through their unique characteristics. It's useful for software licensing, device authentication, and detecting suspicious activity.

The library handles:
- Cryptographic operations (HMAC, AES-GCM encryption)
- Post-Quantum Cryptography (Dilithium3, Kyber1024) for quantum-resistant security
- Device fingerprint generation from hardware specs
- Secure encrypted storage
- ML-based anomaly detection for unusual behavior

I've prepared three fuzz targets to test the main components:
- `fuzz_crypto.py` - Tests the crypto functions including PQC operations
- `fuzz_fingerprint.py` - Tests fingerprint generation logic
- `fuzz_storage.py` - Tests secure storage operations

**Repository:** https://github.com/Johnsonajibi/DeviceFingerprinting  
**Contact:** ajibijohnson@gmail.com  
**License:** MIT

The project has good test coverage and is actively maintained. I'm looking forward to continuous fuzzing to help find any security issues, especially in the quantum-resistant cryptographic implementations!

Thanks for reviewing!
