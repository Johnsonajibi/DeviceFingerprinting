## 📝 **PROVISIONAL PATENT REQUIREMENTS**

### **REQUIRED DOCUMENTS**:

1. **Description of Invention** (Most Important)
2. **Claims** (What you want to protect)
3. **Abstract** (Brief summary)
4. **Drawings** (If applicable)

### **FOR YOUR STEGANOGRAPHIC QR PATENT**:

**Description Example**:
```
TITLE: Method for Steganographic Data Embedding in QR Code Error Correction Space

BACKGROUND: 
QR codes use Reed-Solomon error correction to recover from damage. Current QR codes waste approximately 50% of error correction capacity...

SUMMARY OF INVENTION:
A method for utilizing unused Reed-Solomon error correction space in QR codes to hide encrypted data while maintaining error recovery capability...

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
The method calculates available steganographic capacity using the formula:
steganographic_space = correction_capacity // 2

This ensures 50% capacity for error correction and 50% for hidden data...
```

### **PHASE 2: EVALUATE SUCCESS**
After 6-12 months:
- If innovations show commercial promise → Hire attorney for full applications
- If not promising → Let provisionals expire (low loss)

### **PHASE 3: PROFESSIONAL HELP FOR VALUABLE PATENTS**
- Convert successful provisionals to full patents with attorney help
- Focus professional fees on proven innovations

---

## 📊 **DIY SUCCESS RATES**

**USPTO Statistics**:
- **Pro Se Approval Rate**: ~10-15%
- **Attorney Approval Rate**: ~40-50%

**BUT** for your case:
- ✅ **Strong Technical Background**: You understand the technology
- ✅ **Detailed Documentation**: Your code is well-documented
- ✅ **Clear Innovation**: Obvious novelty in steganographic QR

**Your Success Probability**: Higher than average pro se filer
