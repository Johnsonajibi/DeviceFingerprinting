## üìù **NEXT STEPS FOR PATENT FILING**

### **1. Document Everything (Do This Now!)**
```bash
# Create detailed technical documentation
git add steganographic_qr/ dual_qr_recovery/
git commit -m "Document patent-pending innovations for filing"
```

### **2. Prior Art Search**
- Search existing patents for similar technologies
- Document differences and novel aspects
- Build case for non-obviousness

### **3. Professional Patent Attorney**
- Find attorney specializing in cryptography/software patents
- Prepare detailed technical specifications
- File provisional patent applications for priority dates

### **4. Trade Secret vs Patent Decision**
Some algorithms might be better as trade secrets:
