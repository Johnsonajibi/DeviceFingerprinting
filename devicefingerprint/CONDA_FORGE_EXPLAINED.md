# Conda-Forge Process for DeviceFingerprint Library

## ðŸ“‹ **Your Submission Journey**

### **Stage 1: Staged Recipes (Current)**
```
Repository: conda-forge/staged-recipes
Your Path: recipes/device-fingerprinting-pro/meta.yaml
Status: Ready to submit
```

**What you submit**:

### **Stage 2: Review Process (1-2 weeks)**

**Automated Checks**:
- âœ… Recipe syntax validation
- âœ… Build tests on Windows/macOS/Linux  
- âœ… Dependency resolution
- âœ… Import tests
- âœ… Package metadata validation

**Human Review**:
- ðŸ‘¥ Conda-forge maintainers review your recipe
- ðŸ’¬ May request changes or improvements
- âœ… Approve if everything looks good

**Common Review Items**:
- Recipe follows conda-forge conventions
- All dependencies are available in conda-forge
- Tests are sufficient
- Metadata is complete and accurate

### **Stage 3: Feedstock Creation (Automatic)**

Once approved, conda-forge creates:

```
Repository: conda-forge/device-fingerprinting-pro-feedstock
URL: https://github.com/conda-forge/device-fingerprinting-pro-feedstock
```

**This repository contains**:
- Your recipe (copied from staged-recipes)
- CI/CD configuration files
- Automated build scripts
- Update mechanisms

### **Stage 4: Package Availability (Immediate)**

After feedstock creation:

```bash
# Users can install via conda
conda install -c conda-forge device-fingerprinting-pro

# Or via mamba (faster)
mamba install -c conda-forge device-fingerprinting-pro
```
